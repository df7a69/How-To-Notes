Hello!

Updating /var/ossec/ruleset/sca/cis_centos8_linux.yml on the manager will not update it on new agents. To distribute a modified version you can use centralized configuration.

To deploy the new policy file to all your affected agents copy the file to a group where the agents are included, for example, the default group:
cp /var/ossec/ruleset/sca/cis_centos8_linux.yml.disabled /var/ossec/etc/shared/default/cis_centos8_linux_modified.yml

Modify the new policy /var/ossec/etc/shared/default/cis_centos8_linux_modified.yml to include your operating systems:


requirements:
 title: "Check Centos 8 family platform"
 description: "Requirements for running the policy against CentOS 8 family."
 condition: any
 rules:
  - 'f:/etc/redhat-release -> r:^Centos && r:release 8'
  - 'f:/etc/redhat-release -> r:^AlmaLinux && r:release 8'

Make sure the file is owned by the ossec user and group so it will be distributed using the centralized configuration:
chown ossec: /var/ossec/etc/shared/default/cis_centos8_linux_modified.yml

Add the following configuration to your group's centralized configuration, for example /var/ossec/etc/shared/default/agent.conf :
    <sca>
        <policies>
            <policy>/var/ossec/etc/shared/cis_centos8_linux_modified.yml</policy>
        </policies>
    </sca>

The agents will receive the new configuration and automatically restart to apply it.

Enable sca.remote_commands to allow the execution of commands from SCA policies pushed from the manager in the shared configuration. Add sca.remote_commands=1 on each agent's /var/ossec/etc/local_internal_options.conf. For security reasons, this change has to be made locally on each agent.

Remove the old policy to avoid conflicts  rm /var/ossec/ruleset/sca/cis_centos8_linux.yml. Restart the agent so the changes can take effect.

Regarding your first question, I think I'd be a good idea to modify the official policy to include these operating systems, feel free to open an issue in https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/new/choose so our development team will consider this change.

Best regards,
Sandra.
